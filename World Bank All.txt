- The query returned all the countries names which are in the region Africa. 
The output returned active projects,countryshortname, lendprojectcost  etc.


2) Convert this SQL code to MongoDB:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM world_bank WHERE regionname = “South Asia”

Answer:

db.world_bank.find({  "regionname": “South Asia” }).count()

 - The aggratege method count() in order to get the number of projects 
based on the South Asia region. 
65 projects were shown (only the number due to the count function).


3) Convert this SQL code to MongoDB:

SELECT project_name FROM world_bank WHERE lendprojectcost>1000000

Answer:

db.world_bank.find({  "lendprojectcost":{ "$gt" : 1000000 }},{   "project_name": 1});

- The $gt method to show all the projects that have lendproject cost 
bigger than 1000000 and by writing project_name: 
1 we got the following output where the matching projects are shown.


4) Which are the three countries in the MENA region(“Middle east & North Africa”) with the most projects?

5) Which region has the  largest total amount of lend project cost?

Asnwer: South Asia has the largest total amount of lend project cost.

6) Which active projects have a lend project cost of over 1 billion USD?
