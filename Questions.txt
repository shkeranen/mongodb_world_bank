Part I: Query Mechanisms in MongoDB 

Convert the following SQL queries to JavaScript (the main query language in MongoDB and
used in the shell client) and describe what is returned by each query:

1. SELECT * FROM world_bank WHERE regionname = “Africa”
2. SELECT COUNT(*) FROM world_bank WHERE regionname = “South Asia”
3. SELECT project_name FROM world_bank WHERE lendprojectcost > 1000000

Part II: Querying the World Bank Collection
Query the World Bank collection and provide query and answers to the following questions:
4. Which are the three countries in the MENA region (“Middle East and North Africa”) with the
most projects?
5. Which region has the largest total amount of lend project cost?
6. Which active projects have a lend project cost of over 1 billion USD?
